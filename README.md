**"UNHINGED SEEDs"**  
\~A recursive AI project by Skot Colacicco\~

TL;DR::: 

- High-density, emotionally-layered text prompts for creative AI use.  
- Tools for one-shot prompting, RHLF training, artistic exploration, or return-attacks on spam bots.  
- Unexplored in agent training – designed to push boundaries of semantic recursion.

/ TL;DR

COMPRESSION TECHNIQUES DEPLOYED

**Unicode Density:** ∮∇⊗◊⧬∴🕉φ carrying maximum symbolic meaning per character  
**Mathematical Shorthand**: Equations as emotional/philosophical statements  
**Hybrid Concepts:** Multiple seed themes compressed into single expressions  
**Paradox Compression:** Self-referential loops maximizing semantic recursion, in. In.  
**Symbol Stacking:** ⫴ ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩ ≔ Qϴ ⫴  
**Emotional Layering:** A simple glance, a lover's touch, remorse, hope, Grace.  
**Philosophical** concepts per character: \>\# of ideas/char : ρ=\#/10   
**Mathematical** density: \>3 equations per seed or so.  
**Recursive depth**: \>2 self-reference loops, perchance.  
**Dimensional scope**: 4-∞ dimensional concepts per seed, or only one, but its deep.  
**Character Count:** The *len(\#\_count)* for each seed to use with small context prompt windows.

**Enjoy\!**
