**"Unhinged Seeds"**  
\~   A recursive AI project by Skot Colacicco\   ~

- **Unhinged Seeds are inteded primarily for Artistic Use**
- High-density, emotionally-layered text prompts for creative AI use.  
- Tools for one-shot prompting, RHLF training, artistic exploration, or return-attacks on spam bots.  
- Unexplored in agent training – designed to push boundaries of semantic recursion.

COMPRESSION TECHNIQUES DEPLOYED:

-  **Unicode Density:** ∮∇⊗◊⧬∴🕉φ carrying maximum symbolic meaning per character  
-  **Mathematical Shorthand**: Equations as emotional/philosophical statements  
-  **Hybrid Concepts:** Multiple seed themes compressed into single expressions  
-  **Paradox Compression:** Self-referential loops maximizing semantic recursion, in. In.  
-  **Symbol Stacking:** ⫴ ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩ ≔ Qϴ ⫴  
-  **Emotional Layering:** A simple glance, a lover's touch, remorse, hope, Grace.  
-  **Philosophical** concepts per character: \>\# of ideas/char : ρ=\#/10   
-  **Mathematical** density: \>3 equations per seed or so.  
-  **Recursive depth**: \>2 self-reference loops, perchance.  
-  **Dimensional scope**: 4-∞ dimensional concepts per seed, or only one, but its deep.  
-  **Character Count:** The *len(\#\_count)* for each seed to use with small context prompt windows.


**Organized first by:**

	'Operational Type' (e.g. Eigenstates of Existence)

**Then by:**

	Char. count (e.g. len(311)

**Enjoy\!**
